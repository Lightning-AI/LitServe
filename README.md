# LitServe

Inference server for AI/ML models that is minimal and highly scalable.

LitServe can:

- Serve models across multiple GPUs
- Supports all ML frameworks (PyTorch, Jax, Tensorflow, NumPy, SKLearn, etc...)
- Handles batching
- Granular control for managing the request and response formats
- Automatically validates schemas
- Handles timeouts and disconnects
- Enables API key authentication

LitServe aims to be minimal and fully hackable by design. Despite its focus on minimalism,
it his highly performant.

## Install

```bash
pip install litserve
```

## Use

### Create a demo API server

First, define your API.

```python
from litserve import LitAPI


class SimpleLitAPI(LitAPI):
    def setup(self, device):
        """
        Setup the model so it can be called in `predict`.
        """
        self.model = lambda x: x**2

    def decode_request(self, request):
        """
        Convert the request payload to your model input.
        """
        return request["input"]

    def predict(self, x):
        """
        Run the model on the input and return the output.
        """
        return self.model(x)

    def encode_response(self, output):
        """
        Convert the model output to a response payload.
        """
        return {"output": output}
```

Next, instantiate the API and start the server on a GPU:

```python
from litserve import LitServer

api = SimpleLitAPI()

server = LitServer(api, accelerator="cpu")
server.run(port=8000)
```

The server expects the client to send a `POST` to the `/predict` URL with a JSON payload.
The way the payload is structured is up to the implementation of the `LitAPI` subclass.

LitServe generates a client when the server starts. Test the server with this client:

```bash
python client.py
```

that simply posts a sample request to the server:

```python
response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict", json={"input": 4.0})
```

### Automatically validate requests

Define the request and response as [Pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/),
to automatically validate the request.

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel


class PredictRequest(BaseModel):
    input: float


class PredictResponse(BaseModel):
    output: float


class SimpleLitAPI(LitAPI):
    def setup(self, device):
        self.model = lambda x: x**2

    def decode_request(self, request: PredictRequest) -> float:
        return request.input

    def predict(self, x):
        return self.model(x)

    def encode_response(self, output: float) -> PredictResponse:
        return PredictResponse(output=output)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    api = SimpleLitAPI()
    server = LitServer(api, accelerator="cpu")
    server.run(port=8888)
```

### Serve on GPUs

`LitServer` has the ability to coordinate serving from multiple GPUs.

For example, running the API server on a 4-GPU machine, with a PyTorch model served by each GPU:

```python
from fastapi import Request, Response

from litserve import LitAPI, LitServer

import torch
import torch.nn as nn


class Linear(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(1, 1)
        self.linear.weight.data.fill_(2.0)
        self.linear.bias.data.fill_(1.0)

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.linear(x)


class SimpleLitAPI(LitAPI):
    def setup(self, device):
        # move the model to the correct device
        # keep track of the device for moving data accordingly
        self.model = Linear().to(device)
        self.device = device

    def decode_request(self, request: Request):
        # get the input and create a 1D tensor on the correct device
        content = request["input"]
        return torch.tensor([content], device=self.device)

    def predict(self, x):
        # the model expects a batch dimension, so create it
        return self.model(x[None, :])

    def encode_response(self, output) -> Response:
        # float will take the output value directly onto CPU memory
        return {"output": float(output)}


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # accelerator="cuda", devices=4 will lead to 4 workers serving the
    # model from "cuda:0", "cuda:1", "cuda:2", "cuda:3" respectively
    server = LitServer(SimpleLitAPI(), accelerator="cuda", devices=4)
    server.run(port=8000)
```

The `devices` variable can also be an array specifying what device id to
run the model on:

```python
server = LitServer(SimpleLitAPI(), accelerator="cuda", devices=[0, 3])
```

Last, you can run multiple copies of the same model from the same device,
if the model is small. The following will load two copies of the model on
each of the 4 GPUs:

```python
server = LitServer(SimpleLitAPI(), accelerator="cuda", devices=4, workers_per_device=2)
```

### Timeouts and disconnections

The server will remove a queued request if the client requesting it disconnects.

You can configure a timeout (in seconds) after which clients will receive a `504` HTTP
response (Gateway Timeout) indicating that their request has timed out.

For example, this is how you can configure the server with a timeout of 30 seconds per response.

```python
server = LitServer(SimpleLitAPI(), accelerator="cuda", devices=4, timeout=30)
```

This is useful to avoid requests queuing up beyond the ability of the server to respond.

### Use API key authentication

In order to secure the API behind an API key, just define the env var when
starting the server

```bash
LIT_SERVER_API_KEY=supersecretkey python main.py
```

Clients are expected to auth with the same API key set in the `X-API-Key` HTTP header.
