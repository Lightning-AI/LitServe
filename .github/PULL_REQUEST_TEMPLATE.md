## ‚ö†Ô∏è How does this PR impact the user? ‚ö†Ô∏è
Describe (in plain English, not technical Jargon) how this improves the user experience. If you can't tie it back to a real tangible, user goal or describe it in plain english, it's a hint that this is likely not needed and is probably an "engineering nit". 

### GOOD:
"As a user, I need to serve models faster. This PR focuses on enabling speed gains by using GPUs"

### BAD:
"This PR enables GPUs". 
This is bad because the *user problem* is not clear... instead it just jumps to the solution without any context. 

PRs without this will not be merged.
