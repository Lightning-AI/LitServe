1. Create a [Studio](https://lightning.ai/studios).    
2. Reproduce the issue in the Studio.    
3. [Publish the Studio](https://lightning.ai/docs/overview/studios/publishing#how-to-publish).
4. Paste the Studio link here.    

<!-- If you have a code sample, error messages, stack traces, please provide it here as well -->

#### Code sample
