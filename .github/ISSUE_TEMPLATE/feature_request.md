### ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE SUBMITTING, READ:

We're excited for your request! However, here are things we are not interested in:

- Decorators.
- Doing the same thing in multiple ways.    
- Adding more layers of abstraction... tree-depth should be 1 at most.
- Features that over-engineer or complicate the code internals.    
- Linters, and crud that complicates projects.
